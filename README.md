I've always been drawn to working with computers, exploring different areas such as audio editing, UI design, video editing and gaming. While I dabbled in these areas to some extent, gaming became my main focus. However, my passion for computer work has remained strong and I can see myself still immersed in it 40 years from now. However, the title "developer" always seemed a little intimidating, as I believed it required formal education or a certain level of academic ability. Nevertheless, the desire to be part of the field persisted.
By chance, I crossed paths with friends who worked in front-end and back-end development, and they introduced me to the possibility of coding bootcamps. They shared that these bootcamps could open doors and lead to opportunities in the industry. Intrigued, I delved deeper into the idea and promptly jumped at the opportunity to enroll in a bootcamp. Over the course of a rigorous 5-month programme, I underwent intensive training in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for front-end development. On the backend, I immersed myself in nextJS, nodeJS, Express JS and MongoDB.

These newfound skills allowed me to further hone my development skills and specialise in web development. It's worth noting that I have a penchant for typing on mechanical keyboards and enjoy assembling custom keyboards to optimise both the tactile experience and the sound.

What really appeals to me about this profession is the fact that learning never stops and challenges are a constant companion. I enjoy unravelling complex problems and using my creative and analytical skills. Working as part of a team of like-minded individuals, all working towards a common goal, has proven to be immensely rewarding.


This passion, my affinity for computer work and my drive for continuous growth and overcoming complex challenges motivate and drive me forward.
I relish the opportunity to express my creativity and exercise autonomy, and I welcome the new challenges that come my way.
