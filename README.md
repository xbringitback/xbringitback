   <summary><h3>üë®‚ÄçüíªMy Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I've always been drawn to working with computers, exploring various realms like audio editing, UI design, video editing, and gaming. While I dabbled in these areas to some extent, gaming became my primary focus. Nevertheless, my passion for computer work remained strong, and I can envision myself still immersed in it even 40 years from now. However, the title of "Developer" always seemed a bit intimidating, as I believed it required formal education or a certain level of academic prowess. Yet, the desire to be part of this field persisted.

Fortuitously, I crossed paths with friends working in frontend and backend development who enlightened me about the option of coding bootcamps. They shared that these bootcamps could open doors and lead to opportunities in the industry. Intrigued, I delved deeper into this idea and promptly seized the opportunity to enroll in a bootcamp. Over the span of a rigorous 6-month program, I underwent intensive training in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for frontend development. In the backend realm, I immersed myself in nextJS, nodeJS, Express JS, and MongoDB.

These newfound skills enabled me to further refine my developer capabilities and specialize in the field of web development. It's worth noting that I have a penchant for typing on mechanical keyboards and take pleasure in assembling custom keyboards to optimize both the tactile experience and sound.

What truly captivates me about this profession is the fact that learning never ceases and challenges are a constant companion. I find joy in unraveling intricate problems and leveraging my creative and analytical faculties. Collaborating within a team of like-minded individuals, all working toward a shared goal, has proven immensely enriching.

This fervor, my affinity for computer work, and my drive for continual growth and conquering complex challenges motivate and propel me forward. I relish the opportunity to express my creativity and exercise autonomy, readily embracing new trials that come my way.
